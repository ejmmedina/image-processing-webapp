# Web Application for Basic Image Pre-processing Techniques
##### Data Applications (Web) individual project by Elijah Justin Medina

This web application performs pre-processing on images, particularly on traditional image segmentation techniques. After selecting an image, a mask is created by selecting threshold RGB values with which to separate the foreground and background. Due to the dirty nature of this separation, morphological operations can be performed to clean up the mask. Basically, this application serves as a short tutorial for traditional image processing techniques.

##### Deployment

The project is initially deployed on a personal domain (that has already expired), hosted using Amazon's EC2, Flask, and nginx.
